# **Node API Clean Architecture**

The purpose of this application was to build a well-defined and decoupled architecture, using TDD as the working methodology, Clean Architecture to distribute responsibilities in layers, always following the principles of SOLID and, whenever possible, applying Design Patterns to solve some common problems.
